# cdeep3m-colabs
CDeep3M installation and interface on Colabs


**CDeep3M Preview**: 

The easiest way to run CDeep3M (for free!) is using the CDeep3M preview function: [CDeep3M-Preview at the cellimagelibrary.org](https://cdeep3m.crbs.ucsd.edu/cdeep3m)

# CDeep3M-Colabs-Prediction-GUI: 

This provides a quick entry point with graphical user interface (GUI) to run CDeep3M on your own using Googles free GPUs.

# CDeep3M-Colabs-CLI (command line interface): 

If you are comfortable using a command line interface, this provides the most flexible way to use all functionality of CDeep3M while using Googles free GPUs. It performs the complete CDeep3M installation and sets you up with the CDeep3M CLI on colabs.

# CDeep3M-Colabs-Training-GUI:

This provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to run a CDeep3M training on your own using Googles free GPUs.
Disclaimer: Due to the limited runtime and potential interuption during the execution, training a network from scratch on Colabs is not recommended. please either consider re-training a network from the modelzoo or starting a training from scratch using a Docker container and accessible GPUs in this case.

For the purpose of testing this on colabs anyways, start here:
